# SaaS Notion Clone with Realtime cursors, Nextjs 13, Stripe, Drizzle ORM, Tailwind, Supabase, Sockets

> [!CAUTION]
> **Unfortunately, there is a delay of 1 minute before the cold start of the application. It's not me but a Render free tier. I can't deploy this app on Vercel because they don't support web sockets and serverless, so I deployed it on Render (because it's free).**
